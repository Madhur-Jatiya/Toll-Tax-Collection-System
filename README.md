# Toll-Tax-Collection-System
The Toll Tax Collection System is a command line application developed in C language. Its primary purpose is to collect toll tax from various types of vehicles and count the total number of different vehicles that cross the Toll Plaza.

The system is designed to be user-friendly and efficient. Upon starting the application, the user is prompted to enter the type of vehicle (car, bus, truck, etc.) and the number of wheels it has. Based on this input, the system calculates the toll tax amount for that vehicle and adds it to the total collection. The toll tax rates are pre-defined for each vehicle type and are configurable based on user requirements.

Additionally, the system keeps a count of the number of vehicles that have crossed the Toll Plaza, which can be viewed at any time during or after the toll collection process. This count provides valuable insights into the traffic patterns and helps in planning for future toll collection.

The Toll Tax Collection System is a simple yet effective tool for managing toll collection at a plaza. Its features can be further enhanced with additional modules such as real-time monitoring and reporting, which can be implemented based on the user's needs.

Overall, the Toll Tax Collection System is a useful and practical application that streamlines toll collection and provides valuable data for planning and decision-making.
