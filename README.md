# Toll-Tax-Collection-System
This is a basic command line project created using the C language that is designed to collect toll tax from different types of vehicles and count the total number of vehicles that cross the Toll Plaza. The project is user-friendly and efficient, with pre-defined toll tax rates for each vehicle type that can be configured based on user requirements.
